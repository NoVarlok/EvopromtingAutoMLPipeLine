# EvoPrompting
This project is based on the paper: [EvoPrompting: Language Models for Code-Level Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14838.pdf) by Angelica Chen, David M. Dohan, and David R. So.

The authors successfully demonstrate the application of an evolutionary algorithm with an LLM to create novel machine learning architectures for the MNIST problem. In this project, we attempt to replicate their success for reinforcement learning algorithms.

This repository provides implementation of EvoPrompting for NAS problem for tabular data and it is part of the Auto-ML pipeline
