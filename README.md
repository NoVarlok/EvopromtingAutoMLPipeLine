Evoprompting on Reinforcmenet Learning Architectures. 

This project is heavily based on the the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14838.pdf
All thanks to the authors: Angelica Chen 1 2 David M. Dohan * 3 David R. So * 3

The paper uses an evolutionary algorithm with an LLM as crossover operator in order to create 
NOVEL machine learning architectures for the MNIST problem. 

Here i try to do the same thing but for Reinforcement learning algorithms. 
We replace task T and dataset D with task T and environment E (Carptpole-V1). 

As seed code implemenetations we take the minimal implementation of some fan favorite algorithms (AC2, ACER, DQN, PPO, REINFORCE). 

Results will be published soon!
