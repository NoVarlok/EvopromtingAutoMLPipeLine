# LLMs for AutoML

This repository provides AutoML pipeline that consist from:
* Synthetic tabular data generation using BeGreat - ['Language Models are Realistic Tabular Data Generators'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06280)
* Data preprocessing with CAFFE - ['Large Language Models for Automated Data Science: Introducing CAAFE for Context-Aware Automated Feature Engineering'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03403.pdf)
* NAS with Evoprompting - ['EvoPrompting: Language Models for Code-Level Neural Architecture Search'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14838.pdf)
